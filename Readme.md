This repository contains Python scripts designed to detect common OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in web applications. These scripts aim to assist security professionals, developers, and penetration testers in identifying potential security weaknesses within web applications.

## Features

- **SQL Injection Detection**: Detects potential SQL injection vulnerabilities by testing URLs and HTML forms for common SQL error responses.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Detection**: [Add details if your script includes this feature]
- **Other Features**: [List any other vulnerability detections your scripts cover]

## Prerequisites

To use these scripts, ensure you have:

- Python 3.x installed
- Necessary Python libraries like `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, etc. installed. (You can install them via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/owasp-vulnerability-detection.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the scripts:

    ```bash
    python detect_sql_injection.py
    # Adjust command based on the script you want to run
    ```

## Vulnerabilities Covered

The Python scripts currently cover detection for the following OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities:
